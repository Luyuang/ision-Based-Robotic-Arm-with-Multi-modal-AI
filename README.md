## Vision-Based Intelligent Robotic Arm with Multimodal AI
This experiment developws of a vision-based intelligent robotic arm augmented with multimodal artificial intelligence, aiming to advance human-robot interaction through the seamless integration of visual perception, natural language understanding, and sensory feedback. A custom-designed 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic arm, inspired by 
industrial manipulators, was engineered to facilitate precise kinematic control and modular adaptability. 

The methodology encompasses a rigorous kinematic analysis utilizing the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention, camera calibration for accurate 3D reconstruction, and 
a multimodal AI framework combining state-of-the-art object detection and vision-language models. The systemâ€™s performance was evaluated through controlled experiments 
focusing on object detection, vision-guided manipulation, and voice-driven task execution. 

This work contributes to the field by demonstrating the efficacy of multimodal AI in enhancing robotic adaptability, offering insights into the integration of heterogeneous sensory 
inputs for complex task execution. The findings underscore the potential of such systems 
in applications requiring dynamic interaction, such as industrial automation and assistive 
robotics, while highlighting areas for further refinement in precision and real-time processing.
